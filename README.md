# Autobuild game website

This website allows you to upload and download vehicles you make in the game Autobuild. To upload your builds simply create an account, go to the profile page, click on 'create post' and upload your build! If you just want to download other builds, no need to create an account!

Note: The tires that are used in the game aren't displayed in the website's render of the vehicle due to potential performance issues on lower end devices.
